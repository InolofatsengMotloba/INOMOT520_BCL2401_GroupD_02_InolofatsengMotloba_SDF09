# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

In this project, I developed a responsive footer for a web page using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

### Reflections

This exercise was designed to strengthen my understanding of CSS fundamentals, responsive design principles, and the practical application of Tailwind CSS. I do have some sort of understanding of the concepts but cannot confidently say I fully understand Tailwind CSS.

#### Areas of Mastery

- **Tailwind CSS**: I was able to follow instructions step by step and implementing them with the help of all the resources provided. 
- **Git and GitHub**: Through practice and Videos, I was able to push. 

#### Challenges Faced

- **Flex**: My previous knowledge was not sufficient. I had to do more research on FlexBox.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Code Optimization**: My work is satisfactory but I know I can do better.
- **Creative Design Choices**: There was no creative freedom which I enjoy most.

#### Overall Learning Experience
This project was a bit challenging here and there but overall, it was okay.
